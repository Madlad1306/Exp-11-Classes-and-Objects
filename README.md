# Experiment: Classes and Objects in C++

### AIM

To study **Classes and Objects** in C++.

---

### Software Used

* Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

---

### Theory

#### üîπ Introduction

In **C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, classes and objects form the foundation.

* A **class** is a blueprint that defines properties (data members) and behaviors (member functions).
* An **object** is an instance of a class, representing real-world entities inside the program.

---

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Class

A **class** groups related data and functions into a single unit.

**Characteristics of Classes:**

* Encapsulate data (attributes) and functions (methods).
* Support **access specifiers** (`public`, `private`, `protected`).
* Provide **abstraction** by hiding implementation details.
* Act as blueprints for creating multiple objects.

---

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Object

An **object** is a real entity created from a class.

**Key Points About Objects:**

* Each object has its own copy of class variables.
* Objects interact through class methods.
* Multiple objects can be created from one class.

---

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Benefits of Classes and Objects

* **Encapsulation** ‚Üí Data hiding and security.
* **Abstraction** ‚Üí Hides complexity, shows only essentials.
* **Reusability** ‚Üí Write once, use multiple times.
* **Modularity** ‚Üí Breaks program into smaller manageable units.
* **Inheritance** (optional) ‚Üí Code extension from parent class.
* **Polymorphism** (optional) ‚Üí Same function behaves differently in different contexts.

### Algorithms

#### Program 1: Student Details using Class

**Algorithm**

1. Start program.
2. Define a class `Student` with attributes: `name`, `branch`, `subject`, `result`.
3. Create objects `s1` and `s2`.
4. Assign details to each student.
5. Display student details.
6. End program.

---

#### Program 2: Vehicle Details using Class (Car and Bike)

**Algorithm**

1. Start program.
2. Define classes `Car` and `Bike` with attributes: `name`, `brand`, `colour`, `year`, `cost`.
3. Create objects for 2 cars and 2 bikes.
4. Input details from user.
5. Display details of vehicles.
6. End program.

---

#### Program 3: Calculator using Class and Methods

**Algorithm**

1. Start program.
2. Define a class `Calculator` with members `a` and `b`.
3. Define methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
4. Take two numbers as input.
5. Call methods and display results.
6. Handle division by zero if entered.
7. End program.

---

#### Program 4: Defining Methods Inside and Outside a Class

**Algorithm**

1. Start program.
2. Define a class `MyClass` with attributes: `height`, `width`, `length`.
3. Define method `Volume()` **inside** class.
4. Declare method `myVolume()` inside but **define outside** the class.
5. In `main()`, create object `M1`.
6. Call both methods to display cuboid volume.
7. Stop program.

### Conclusion

* **Classes** are templates that combine data and functions into one unit.
* **Objects** are instances of classes that allow real-world modeling in C++.
* Using classes and objects provides **modularity, reusability, abstraction, and encapsulation**, making programs more efficient and maintainable.
* Methods in C++ can be defined both **inside and outside** the class, giving flexibility in design.


Would you like me to also **write the sample C++ code implementations** for all 4 programs (Student, Vehicle, Calculator, and Method definition) so you can add them directly to your lab record?
